# Guidelines for Contributing to {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

Contributions are always welcome. You can contribute by sending feedback 
(use our [issue tracker][] for that) or by proposing a code change via a 
[Pull Request][]

The {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} repository uses the [GithubFlow][] branching 
model (i.e. features are developed on individual feature branches 
and they are eventually merged into the master branch, which is 
considered always "deployable".


For the contributions, we use the [Fork & Pull Model][]:

1. the contributor first [forks][] the official repository
2. the contributor commits changes to a branch based on the 
   `master` branch and pushes it to the forked repository.
3. the contributor creates a [Pull Request][] against the `master` 
   branch of the official repository.
4. anybody interested may review and comment on the Pull Request, and 
   suggest changes to it (even doing Pull Requests against the Pull
   Request branch). At this point more changes can be committed on the 
   requestor's branch until the result is satisfactory.
5. once the proposed code is considered ready by an appointed taurus 
   integrator, the integrator merges the pull request into `master`.
   
   
## Important considerations:

In general, the contributions should consider following:

- The code must comply with the [Taurus coding conventions][]

- The contributor must be clearly identified. The commit author 
  email should be valid and usable for contacting him/her.
  
- Commit messages should follow the [commit message guidelines][]. 
  Contributions may be rejected if their commit messages are poor.
  
- The licensing terms for the contributed code must be compatible 
  with (and preferably the same as) the license chosen for the Taurus 
  project (at the time of writing this, it is the [LGPL][], 
  version 3 *or later*).

   
## Notes:
  
- This workflow is slightly different to the one used for the main
  taurus repo, (which uses [gitflow][]), but the contribution guidelines
  are very similar. Basically, the role of the `develop` branch in the 
  taurus repo is done by the `master` branch in this repo.
  
- If the contributor wants to explicitly bring the attention of some 
  specific person to the review process, [mentions][] can be used
  
- If a pull request (or a specific commit) fixes an open issue, the pull
  request (or commit) message may contain a `Fixes #N` tag (N being 
  the number of the issue) which will automatically [close the related 
  Issue][tag_issue_closing]
