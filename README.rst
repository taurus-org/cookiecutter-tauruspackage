Quickstart
----------

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

    pip install -U cookiecutter

or, in debian-based distros:

    apt install cookiecutter

Generate a Taurus package project::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/taurus-org/cookiecutter-tauruspackage.git

Then:

* Create a repo and put it there (you may consider proposing it to be in the taurus-org Organization).
* Add the repo to your Travis-CI_ account (or ask a taurus-org admin to do it if it is in taurus-org).
* Install the dev requirements into a virtualenv. (``pip install -r requirements_dev.txt``)
* Register_ your project with PyPI (and add the taurus_bot user as a maintainer).
* Use `travis-encrypt`_ command to encrypt your PyPI password and add the encrypted result to `.trvis.yml`
* Add the repo to your ReadTheDocs_ account + turn on the ReadTheDocs service hook.
* Release your package by pushing a new tag to master.
* Add a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the packages you will need for
  your project and their versions. For more info see the `pip docs for requirements files`_.
* Activate your project on `pyup.io`_.
